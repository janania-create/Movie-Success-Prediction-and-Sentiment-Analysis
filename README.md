🎬 Movie Success Prediction & Sentiment Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project predicts movie success using IMDb structured data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on user reviews. Sentiment analysis is performed using VADER, and machine learning models are applied to predict both IMDb ratings and movie success.
